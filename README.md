# Better than Apple Maps
## ECE 470 - Spring 2020

This project is to control a simulated robot to move around in a 3D world, avoiding obstacles and building a 2D represntation of its world while it moves. It can search through its world to locate and pick up items, and deliver them to a predefined location. The motivation behind this is a ‘recycling robot’ that picks up trash and throws it away.
