## Summary
This project is to control a simulated robot to move around in a 3D world, 
avoiding obstacles and building a 2D represntation of its world while it moves. 
It can search through its world to locate and pick up items, and deliver them 
to a predefined location. The motivation behind this is a ‘recycling robot’ 
that picks up trash and throws it away.
